# LTFDyG: Learnable Temporal Function-based Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Dual-channel Encoding

This repository contains the **official implementation** of **LTFDyG**, a dynamic graph neural network model that leverages a learnable temporal function and dual-channel encoding to effectively capture both **global temporal patterns** and **local neighborhood interactions** in dynamic graphs. LTFDyG is designed for tasks such as **dynamic link prediction** and **temporal node representation learning**, demonstrating strong performance across various datasets.

## Key features include:

- **Learnable temporal function** to model continuous-time dynamics  
- **Dual-channel encoding** for combining global temporal context and local neighborhood co-occurrence  
- **Transformer-based architecture** for capturing complex temporal and structural dependencies  
- **Easy-to-use PyTorch implementation** with modular design  

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
